- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZacheryPaterson
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in application development 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript implementations with various API's

Current onging projects include a python stock predictor using machine learning and webscraping and a Unity project for game jams.
Finished projects include 2 discord bots, one of which won't be uploaded as it could be used to exploit a game I don't play.
